# Esso Automation Application Project - Backend

This project was my internship project. The project is creating a website to see cities and countries, and users may also create, delete or update a new or exist city/country. 

In database,
I used `Entity Framework First Code Approach`. I created 3 entities called user, city, country.

In Web API,
I developed CRUD operations in a structure where I can communicate with `Asp .Net Core` and `JSON`data. I also created an authorization process and checked this authorization process with one hour Bearer token. Additionally, I developed the services with `Mediator Design Pattern` and `CQRS Design Pattern`. Lastly, By Pagination, I returned the data in a paged manner, not as a whole, with API methods that read multiple data.
